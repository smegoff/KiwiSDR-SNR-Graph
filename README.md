A pair of Python scripts to:

1. **Continuously poll a KiwiSDR** for SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) statistics via its public `/snr` endpoint and append each snapshot (timestamp + per-band SNR values) to a log file.
    
2. **Read that log file** (or a ‚Äúlatest snapshot‚Äù file) and plot SNR over time for all frequency bands, in your local timezone, with moving-average smoothing, peak annotations, and a midnight-clamped x-axis.

> **Note:** After you run `log_kiwidsr_snr.py`, a new file  
> `data/kiwi_snr_history.log` (inside the `data/` folder) will be created and continuously updated.  
> You can either plot from that history file or, if you prefer a single ‚Äúlatest snapshot‚Äù approach, use `KiwiSDR_Graph.py` with a separate `KiwiSDR_SNR_latest.log` file (see the comments inside that script).

## üìã Requirements

Both scripts assume you have:

- Python 3.7+ (tested on 3.10+)
    
- A working KiwiSDR with access to its `/snr` endpoint (e.g. `http://<KIWI_IP>:8073/snr`).
    

### Python Dependencies

Install the required packages with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of **requirements.txt**:

```
requests
numpy
matplotlib
tzlocal
```

## üîß Script 1: `log_kiwidsr_snr.py`

Continuously polls `<KIWI_BASE_URL>/snr` every 60 seconds (by default), parses the JSON response, and appends a line to the history log:

```
<UTC_ISO_TIMESTAMP> <JSON-dump of snapshot>
```

### Key Features

- Remembers the last KiwiSDR URL you entered (in `last_kiwi_url.txt`) and offers it as a default prompt.
    
- Creates (if needed) a folder called `data/` and a log file named `kiwi_snr_history.log`.
    
- Skips blank or invalid (non-JSON) responses without crashing.
    
- Uses UTC timestamps for uniformity.
    

### Usage

```
python log_kiwidsr_snr.py
```

1. You will be prompted:
    
    ```
    Enter your KiwiSDR base URL (e.g. http://192.168.1.50:8073) [http://last-used-url]:
    ```
    
2. If you type nothing and press Enter, it will reuse the last-saved URL. Otherwise, paste (or type) your new KiwiSDR base URL (e.g. `http://192.168.10.238:8073`) and press Enter.
    
3. The script will print:
    
    ```
    Initialized log at <repo_root>/data/kiwi_snr_history.log
    Starting KiwiSDR SNR logger (poll every 60s)‚Ä¶
    ```
    
4. It will then run indefinitely. Each successful poll & parse writes one line to `data/kiwi_snr_history.log`. Any fetch/parsing errors are printed but do not stop the loop.
    
5. To stop logging and proceed to plotting, press `Ctrl+C`.

## üìä Script 2: `KiwiSDR_Graph.py`

Reads the log file (either the single-line ‚Äúlatest snapshot‚Äù approach or the full `kiwi_snr_history.log`), parses all timestamps and SNR values, then generates a Matplotlib plot:

- **X-axis**: local time in `HH:MM`, clamped from midnight of the first sample date to the last sample.
    
- **Y-axis**: SNR (dB) for each band.
    
- **Smoothing**: a small moving average (window size configurable).
    
- **Annotations**: show the dB value at each band‚Äôs peak point.
    
- **Legend**: placed below the plot, one column per two bands by default.
    
- **Grid**: dashed gridlines for readability.
    
- **Tick intervals**: every 30 minutes.
    

There are two modes:

1. **Graph ‚ÄúLatest Snapshot‚Äù Only**  
    If you maintain a separate file called `KiwiSDR_SNR_latest.log` (each line is a single JSON array of band snapshots), the script will:
    
    - Read **only** the **last non-empty line**.
        
    - Parse that JSON array (the ‚Äúsnapshot history‚Äù).
        
    - Plot **all bands over time** according to that array.
        
    
    In this mode:
    
    ```
    LOG_FILE_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),
                                 "KiwiSDR_SNR_latest.log")
    ```
    
    must point to your single-line file.
    
2. **Graph Full History**  
    If you just ran `log_kiwidsr_snr.py` and want to plot the entire `data/kiwi_snr_history.log` content, call:
    
    ```
    python KiwiSDR_Graph.py --history
    ```
    
    In that case, the script will look for `data/kiwi_snr_history.log` in the same folder and plot **all** snapshots it finds.
    

### Usage Examples

#### A. Plotting from ‚Äúlatest snapshot‚Äù file

1. Copy your single-line JSON file into the same folder as `KiwiSDR_Graph.py` and name it `KiwiSDR_SNR_latest.log`.
    
2. Make sure the first lines of `KiwiSDR_Graph.py` point to:
    
    ```
    LOG_FILE_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),
                                 "KiwiSDR_SNR_latest.log")
    ```
    
3. Run:
    
    ```
    python KiwiSDR_Graph.py
    ```
    
4. A Matplotlib window will appear showing all bands‚Äô smoothed SNR over time for that single ‚Äúsnapshot history.‚Äù
    

#### B. Plotting from full history log

1. After running `log_kiwidsr_snr.py` (and pressing Ctrl+C), you should have a file:
    
    ```
    data/kiwi_snr_history.log
    ```
    
    with many lines like:
    
    ```
    {"ts":"Thu May 22 19:31:52 2025","snr":[{"lo":0,"hi":1800,"snr":5.2},‚Ä¶]}
    {"ts":"Thu May 22 19:32:52 2025","snr":[‚Ä¶]}
    ...
    ```
    
2. Edit the top of `KiwiSDR_Graph.py` so that it reads:
    
    ```
    LOG_FILE_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),
                                 "data/kiwi_snr_history.log")
    ```
    
3. Run:
    
    ```
    python KiwiSDR_Graph.py --history
    ```
    
4. A plot window will appear showing every band‚Äôs smoothed SNR over time, from midnight of the first logged date through the last snapshot.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Inside each script you can tweak:

- **Polling interval** (`POLL_INTERVAL` in `log_kiwidsr_snr.py`).
    
- **Log‚Äêfile location** (`LOG_FILE` or `LOG_DIR`).
    
- **Smoothing window** (`SMOOTH_WINDOW` in `KiwiSDR_Graph.py`).
    
- **Matplotlib figure size**, colors, fonts, etc.
    

All date‚Äìtime parsing is done with `tzlocal` so that X-axis labels reflect your machine‚Äôs local timezone. If you‚Äôd rather force UTC, replace:

```
local_tz = tzlocal.get_localzone()
```

with:

```
from datetime import timezone
local_tz = timezone.utc
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **‚ÄúExtra data‚Ä¶‚Äù**  
    Make sure your log file contains exactly one JSON object per line, each of the form:
    
    ```
    {"ts":"Thu May 22 19:31:52 2025","snr":[{"lo":0,"hi":1800,"snr":5.2}, ‚Ä¶]}
    ```
    
    If you have a ‚Äúsingle‚Äêline‚Äù array of snapshots, be sure you set `LOG_FILE_PATH` to that file and that it starts with `[` and ends with `]`.
    
- **Time labels are off by your timezone**  
    Confirm that `tzlocal` is installed and that your system‚Äôs local timezone is detected correctly. If necessary, hardcode `local_tz = timezone.utc` and adjust `DateFormatter`.
    
- **Plot window opens but is blank**  
    Check that `history = load_history()` returns a non-empty list. Inspect your log file for valid JSON lines. You can manually open `data/kiwi_snr_history.log` and verify that each line is parseable, with `"ts"` and `"snr"` keys.
    
- **Plot starts at a non-midnight timestamp**  
    The script explicitly clamps X-axis to midnight of the first snapshot‚Äôs date. If your first snapshot‚Äôs `ts` is, e.g., `"Thu May 22 00:12:34 2025"`, the ‚Äúmidnight‚Äù clamp is `2025-05-22 00:00:00`. If you see something else, double-check that `dt.replace(hour=0,minute=0,‚Ä¶)` logic is intact.
